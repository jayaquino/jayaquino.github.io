            Chatter Chinese is my most recent project. My inspiration for this application is because, as a typical introvert, it was
            difficult for me to find language exchange partners. To put what I learned into practice and to produce a solution to my personal problem,
            I created this app. Essentially, it's a social app. Features are shown below:

            Bopomofo is a Mandarin Chinese learning app. The most popular way to learn Mandarin is through a romanization system called
            Hanyu Pinyin 漢語拼音. Another system that is less popular is called Zhuyin 注音符號 - Bopomofo. I personally believe that Pinyin is more prone to
            pronunciation errors, and after learning BPMF I soon realized my shortcomings. This application teaches its students the characters and sounds of Zhuyin,
            and also teaches students how to type Chinese Characters using an iPhone Zhuyin style keyboard. Features are shown below:

        <p class = "descriptionAboutMe">
            I was born in the Philippines, at a town called Taal. 
            I lived there for about 8 years before moving to Reno, NV in USA. My parents wanted to pursue a better life for their kids. To be quite frank with you, I can't remember much
            of that past besides my mother-tongue. I went to school in Reno until I graduated college. Obtained my US citizenship at 17, and attended University of Nevada, Reno,
            majoring in Mechanical Engineering, emphasizing robotics coursework with a minor in Electrical Engineering.

            <br><br>

            Why? To be honest, I'm not sure. I felt I just took that path because of others' expectations, or because it was a white-collar job my parents could 
            be proud of. I personally didn't question it at the beginning. 

            <br><br>

            I was calculating mathematical equations trying to figure out how objects moved, and at the same time figuring out why things shouldn't move. I took up apprenticeships
            from professors to learn more about the mechanical world, but the experiments and work proved to be dry to my taste. Then
            I attended a class called Introduction to Numerical Methods. This was the first time I even heard of the word programming. It fascinated me enough
            that when I got good at programming "for Mechanicals", I decided to get a job at the university to help the professor teach underclassmen. Loved it so much
            I kept the position for 2 years.

            <br><br>

            Throughout my junior year I thought, "did I get into the wrong major"? Fast forward to the summer of my senior year I was having second thoughts but I couldn't turn back then, it's too expensive.
            I have to help my parents with our financial situation. I need to graduate. And that's what I did. I graduated, obtained by first job as a Mechanical Engineer. 
            This job led me to come to a beautiful place called Taiwan.

            <br><br>

            I spent 2 or so years in this position, designing radiofrequency medical devices, experimenting, and communicating with clients/customers. Guess what? I was still itching
            to program. I learned some Python and applied it to my work to do repetitive tasks in the meantime, for example scraping experiment documents and creating reports. In my off time
            I was trying to learn Chinese, eventually finding my passion for languages and communication. Eventually, I knew I needed to pursue this itch because it was what I kept thinking about. I thought,
            "what if this, what if that?" and not sure if I took things for granted, but I know for sure I wouldn't find out if I continued the way I was.
            At the moment I'm trying to combine these two in my life. This is what produced the roughly coded Bopomofo Studio and Chatter Chinese. And this website.
